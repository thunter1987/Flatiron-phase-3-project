### How I will use the concepts I recently learned to meet the project requirements

    Object Oriented Python - <Describe how you plan to use Python Classes and Objects to model your application>
    
    Database Tables - <Describe how you will    use SQLAlchemy to create and interact with 2 or more related database tables>

    Object Relationships - <Describe the types of relationships your different classes and tables will have with each other>

    Aggregate and Association Methods - <Describe a few of the methods you plan on including in your application to query your database>

    Use of Data Structures - <Describe how you plan on using data structures like lists and dictionaries in your project>

### What area I think will be most challenging: <Describe which aspect of the project you think will present the greatest challenge, or the topic that you feel least familiar with at present.>
